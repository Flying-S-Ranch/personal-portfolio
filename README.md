# Shrauner-Personal-Portfolio

## Description
This project is a space for me to highlight my best work for potential employers. I have been able to practice and refine the skills that we have learned so far in HTML and CSS. I especially appreciated getting to practice flexbox and enjoyed adding images to my work.
Please take a look at my webpage here: https://flying-s-ranch.github.io/personal-portfolio/. 

## Installation
There are no special instructions for installation. This webpage is available to view at https://flying-s-ranch.github.io/personal-portfolio/.

## Usage
The links in the header take users to the corresponding sections in the webpage:

In the main section, when a user hovers over the image it will turn from black-and-white into color. The user can click on the link to visit the deployed project web pages [this will be true in the future, at the moment these links do not connect to finished projects].

The links in the footer will take users to external websites or open the user's email to send a message:
